## Bioinformatics Stronghold

In this section of the Rosalind Challenges, I move on to analyzing FASTA files and DNA sequences using written code. I switched from using Python Shell to Visual Studio Code.

I have uploaded my code as well as the files used in some of the challenges. The files used within the code may not match the names of the files within this repository because I changed their names prior to upload for easier view. To have the code work, the file path and file names can be altered.
